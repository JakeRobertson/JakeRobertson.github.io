    <td>I learnt by listening to the teacher and following exact instructions to be able to create this GitHub blog. An effective strategy that helped me achieve this was to take notes on my iPad, as often there were lots of complicated things that we were told to do at one time that would be hard to remember.</td>

    <td>Sitting at the back of the classroom since this made seeing the board and listening to the teacher harder, especially as there were many people in the way of my view. Also, I could possibly try to work a bit faster as I had to write most of the blog at home, though I did have to set it up too that lesson.</td>

    <td>To improve my learning, I will try to get a seat at the front of the class and to make sure that I am in a good position to see the board. I will also try my best to work very fast to make sure that I don't have much of the blog to do for homework.</td>
