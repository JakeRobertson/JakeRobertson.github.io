    <td>I had started my spreadsheet, but didn't have any VLookup functions or item quantity. I also had a very basic-looking spreadsheet.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To add VLookup functions and a quantity section. I also want to improve on the looks of my spreadsheet.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt well by paying attention to the teacher telling us how to do all of the functions and I took thorough notes to help me remember since there was a lot of detail. I also figured some of it out for myself which was effective as it helps you learn this way, rather than by having to rely on a teacher or classmate to tell you how to do everything. I ended up managing to add VLookup functions, an amounts section, and I improved the presentation too.

    <td>I need to work on being brief and effective as I used lots of subtotals which were probably unnecessary. </td>

    <td>I will add all that is shown and will try to elaborate on it by adding new ideas that are helpful and make the spreadsheet better.</td>
