    <td>I learnt well by listening to the teacher when required as he gave us instructions on how to do many important things. I also used my own knowledge a lot to think of things to add for costs as I managed to add some such as fuel costs or deliveries. I also did manage to remove the error codes from the empty boxes after taking down careful notes from what we were told by the teacher.</td>
