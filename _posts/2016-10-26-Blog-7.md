    <td>I learnt by going through all of the code many times to try and figure out the problem with it and even with help from a teacher, I couldn't pinpoint the issue. I therefore learnt by taking down all of the code modifications I had done (customisations) as I had to delete all of my code and replace it with the original code. I then managed to customise it a bit with some of the customisations that I had previously done. I did manage to get my blog back up and running, but unfortunately I couldn’t completely replicate all that I had done in many weeks in only one week meaning that the blog looks fairly good, but not as good as previously.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Being stubborn limited my learning to an extent as initially I didn’t want to delete all of my progress and start again, but eventually I realised that this was the best/only option since I need an operational blog to get a mark above zero!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be quicker to determine what is the better option, even if one requires more work or deleting some of my progress since I wasted a significant amount of lesson time trying to get it to work by finding the error, and only once I had gone through it multiple times without getting any ideas about how it was broken I realised that it was best to start again.</td>
