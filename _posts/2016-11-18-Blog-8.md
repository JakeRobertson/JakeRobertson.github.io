(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, I managed to add final customisation to make it look how I wanted it to for marking.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt well by picking up some of the things that others had done to make their blogs look good. We also used peer-assessment effectively as it helped us find out problems with our blogs and certain things that could be improved.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work more on the html as well as the css as I focused mainly on this which could have limited my learning a bit since I have one aspect done well and then another not at the same standard.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time to improve my learning I will work on every part and aspect of the work equally so that they are all good rather than having one great and the rest be okay so that everything is going at the same pace.</td>
